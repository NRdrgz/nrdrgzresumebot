# Resume Chatbot

## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Resume Chatbot! This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to interactively answer questions about someone professional background, leveraging the power of OpenAI's language models. I wanted to experiment a bit with Streamlit, OpenAI API, and give someone to Hiring Manages to catch their attention.

## Features
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Engage in a conversation about someone's skills, experience, and education.
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Utilizes GPT to provide informative and contextually relevant answers.
- **Predefined Queries**: Offers a selection of preset questions for quick and easy exploration of Nicolas's resume.

## Local Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NRdrgz/nrdrgzresumebot.git
   cd nrdrgzresumebot
2. **Run locally**: 
   ```bash
   streamlit run Hello.py

## Configuration
API Key: Set your OpenAI API key in .streamlit/secrets.toml for local development and in Streamlit secrets for online deployment.
Resume Update: Replace Resume_Nicolas_Rodriguez_ENG_Main.pdf with an updated resume as needed.


## Online Setup
Run the code from Streamlit to deploy the app online
